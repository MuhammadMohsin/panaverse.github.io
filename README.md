# Designing and Developing Immersive 3D Metaverse Experiences

[Goldman Sachs Sees the Metaverse as $8 Trillion Opportunity.](https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-metaverse-8-trillion-opportunity/) [Read the paper Opportunities
in the metaverse by JP Morgan.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf)  It is the future and next generation of the internet. This program will teach you to design and build 3D Metaverse Experiences to take advantage of this opportunity.

Panaverse Development Platform

As discussed in detail in this [article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3654197/enterprise-ar-will-be-dominated-by-apple-and-magic-leap.html) we also believe that Apple will lead the AR and Metaverse space on the client side. There [M1 processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) are the most efficient processors in the world. Some derivative of the M1 will power the Apple AR glasses. Apple's [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) is also quite mature. Apple's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language is extremely powerfull. The combination of the hardware and the software stacks will be extremely difficult to beat in the next few years. The main competetors Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google are three to five years behind right now. As developers the only down side is going to be the total lock-in.  

On the backend [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) Cloud combined with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) will provide an extremely scalable platform, with Typescript as the programming language of choice.

To provide Web 3 functionality we will use the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain and [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) programming language for smart contract development. 

We will be using [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/) for 3D Asset development and [USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Scene_Description) file format.

The only hurdle I see in training world class metaverse developers is that every developer will need a at least a [Mac Book Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/). We can buy Apple AR glass on a shared bases when they become available. 



The online program consists of seven modules (three semisters) listed below and will mainly be focused on imparting knowledge by training students to develop projects. The classes will mainly be taught on the weekends or after 7:00 pm (Pakistan Time) on weekdays so that everyone can attend. We will be using Zoom to conduct classes so that students from anywhere in the world can attend. 

## Faculty Application Form

If you are interested in teaching in this program, you are requested to fill out the following form (if shortlisted we will schedule an interview with you):

[Submit the Form](https://forms.gle/SUhyJiqTjABMpeHr9)

Please note that all faculty members will be paid as per industry standards.


## Program Duration and Fee

The program will consist of three semesters. The fee will be Rs. 10,000 per semester. The students will have an option to pay an one time fee of Rs. 20,000 for the entire program covering all three semesters i.e. instead of paying Rs. 30,000 for the program they will pay Rs. 20,000 and get a discount of Rs. 10,000.

Per Semester: Rs. 10,000

One Time: Rs. 20,000 (Covers 3 Semesters)

## Student Waiting List Application Form

If you want to be added to the Student waiting list. 

[Submit the Form](https://forms.gle/BYqLH1atDDcbsHUB7)

When the program is about to start and you are selected for the classes, you will receive a message to submit the fee and start attending classes.

Currenly, Panaverse cannot specify when the program will start. Currently the program is under development and start date is at least many months in the future. 

We suggest that you join the Panaverse community on Discord and Facebook, and start learning Blender skills to begin with.

Universal Scene Description (USD) is an open source framework developed by Pixar for exchanging 3D computer graphics data across different applications. It is designed to be flexible and extensible to other collaborative environments that run interconnected tools, such as NVIDIA Omniverse. More than a dozen companies from Apple, Nvidia, Adobe, to Unity support USD. The standard is on the cusp of becoming the solder that fuses all sorts of virtual and physical worlds into a metaverse.

## Blockchain Project 1: Create a Token and Launch ICO/IEO/IDO


As you probably know, the ICO ("Initial Coin Offering") industry has been booming, and it's completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, go have a look at [Wikipedia's list of highest crowdfunding projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), and you'll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

Your second task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IDO on the [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/).


Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating an token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralised service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use openzeppelin contracts. You will use Harkhat development envirnoment. Also, write at least 20 automated tests. We will be using the Solidity and Typescript for dvelopment.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible to allow users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to
Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal "owner" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the [openzeppelin crowd sale contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales), however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write exentisive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts was uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to "register" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the "Add token" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on "Add custom token" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

Now use [Gnosis Safe]{https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

Project Part 8 Advance: Create, Deploy, Mint, and Sell a NFT

[Read this NFT tutorial series](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)

Create a NFT contract using the [OpenZepplen ERC721 NFT Standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

You may use the [Preset ERC721 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#Presets).

Deploy your NFT contract on a testnet, mint it, and view it on the MetaMask wallet and list it on [OpenSea Marketplace](https://opensea.io/) for sale.
