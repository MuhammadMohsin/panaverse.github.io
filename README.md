# Designing and Developing Immersive 3D Metaverse Experiences

[Goldman Sachs Sees the Metaverse as $8 Trillion Opportunity.](https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-metaverse-8-trillion-opportunity/) [Read the paper Opportunities
in the metaverse by JP Morgan.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf)  It is the future and next generation of the internet. This program will teach you to design and build 3D Metaverse Experiences to take advantage of this opportunity. 

The online program consists of seven modules (three semisters) listed below and will mainly be focused on imparting knowledge by training students to develop projects. The classes will mainly be taught on the weekends or after 7:00 pm (Pakistan Time) on weekdays so that everyone can attend. We will be using Zoom to conduct classes so that students from anywhere in the world can attend. 

## Faculty Application Form

If you are interested in teaching in this program, you are requested to fill out the following form (if shortlisted we will schedule an interview with you):

[Submit the Form](https://forms.gle/SUhyJiqTjABMpeHr9)

Please note that all faculty members will be paid as per industry standards.


## Program Duration and Fee

The program will consist of three semesters. The fee will be Rs. 10,000 per semester. The students will have an option to pay an one time fee of Rs. 20,000 for the entire program covering all three semesters i.e. instead of paying Rs. 30,000 for the program they will pay Rs. 20,000 and get a discount of Rs. 10,000.

Per Semester: Rs. 10,000

One Time: Rs. 20,000 (Covers 3 Semesters)

## Student Waiting List Application Form

If you want to be added to the Student waiting list. 

[Submit the Form](https://forms.gle/BYqLH1atDDcbsHUB7)

When the program is about to start and you are selected for the classes, you will receive a message to submit the fee and start attending classes.

Currenly, Panaverse cannot specify when the program will start. Currently the program is under development and start date is at least many months in the future. 

We suggest that you join the Panaverse community on Discord and Facebook, and start learning Blender skills to begin with.

### Part 2: Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD)

Universal Scene Description (USD) is an open source framework developed by Pixar for exchanging 3D computer graphics data across different applications. It is designed to be flexible and extensible to other collaborative environments that run interconnected tools, such as NVIDIA Omniverse. More than a dozen companies from Apple, Nvidia, Adobe, to Unity support USD. The standard is on the cusp of becoming the solder that fuses all sorts of virtual and physical worlds into a metaverse.
